A Shadowcasting-Based Next-Best-View Planner for 3D Exploration

This repository contains the code for a shadowcasting-based next-best-view planner, presented in the paper:\
**A Shadowcasting-Based Next-Best_View Planner for Autonomous 3D Exploration**\
Ana Batinovic, Antun Ivanovic, Tamara Petrovic and Stjepan Bogdan.

Proposed shadowcasting-based next-best-view planner is capable of autonomously exploring a previously unknown bounded area and creating an OctoMap of the environment. The results showed an improved behaviour in terms of both computation and total exploration time compared to state-of-the-art strategies. The proposed information gain calculation and path evaluation ensures target evaluation in a short computation time, while a novel dead end recovery algorithm speeds up the exploration process. This 3D exploration planner has been successfully tested and analysed in simulation scenarios and compared with state-of-the-are strategies.
